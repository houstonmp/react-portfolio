# Portfolio (React.js)

An updated website/portfolio to showcase my projects and who I am.

## Description

A much needed refresh of my original website.
## Demo - check it out [*here*](https://matthewhouston.dev/)

## Roadmap - (Goals and ToDos)

- Add Skills and Proficiencies section
- Modify styling for smaller devices (styling is a bit wonky atm).
- Add small screen device layout images to the portfolio section and a slider bar to showcase each of the images in the carousel.
- Add images for smaller screens. Some of the images are bit too large and take a lot of time to load.

## My Design Process

I initially intended to use parallax scrolling for this site, however, I had the thought that a carousel-like snapping site would be easier to implement at my level.

### Color Palette and Shapes
Blue is my favorite color so I used a simple monochromatic color palette with several shades of blue. I used simple shapes in the background to provide some decoration but also to add some basic movement and transitions to the page.
